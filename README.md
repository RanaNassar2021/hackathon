hackathon assignment by Rana Nassar,
I'll briefly explain the main components, logic, and approaches I used. 
1) The landing page consists of a home component where I have the desired styles based on the Figma design link and another content component.
2) Content component: in this component, I handled fetching the data of the cards and the search logic, and another component named Basic Tabs where I dealt with the changing between all submissions and favorites.
3) BasicTabs component: in this component, I added the sorting function and another component for favorite submissions.
4) Favorite component: I handled showing the favorite submissions after adding them to the local storage.
5) Card component: in this component, I showed the details of the selected card from the landing page.
6)Submission component: in this component, I made all the details of the submission fields and validation then added them to local storage.
